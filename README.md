# Locate Plasma

The rising of covid cases left a lot of people in need of plasma. Due to this, many are using the help of social media to ask for aid. However, these request are scattered all over media in an unorganized manner. We created this platform which works solely for the purpose of listing patients who are in immediate need so that the donor can find and help them.

The situation of the nation has gotten more severe during these past few weeks. Amidst this crisis, many people are coming forward to offer a helping hand towards the needs of the hour.

This site focuses on helping the COVID-19 patients who are in need of plasma with the people who wish to and capable of donating it.

If you have recovered from COVID-19, you can help others recover too and save lives by donating your plasma.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
